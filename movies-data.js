        whyIncluded: 'Bicycle Thieves presents masculinity through economic vulnerability and emotional complexity rather than traditional strength. Antonio\'s journey shows how external pressures can challenge masculine identity while revealing deeper truths about fatherhood, dignity, and human connection. The film demonstrates that authentic masculinity includes the full range of human emotions and struggles, particularly the vulnerability that comes with caring for others.'
